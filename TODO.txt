/ GPIO Input
/ GPIO Output
- Block for board pin numbers
- Block for PIN DOWN UP switches
# Automatically detect RPi on local network and change IPs in blocks dynamically? Is this even possible?
# Modify a locally available version of Snap! to load with blocks already included. If served from the Pi, that would probably solve the prior feature.
